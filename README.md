# Mask R-CNN for Hairloss detection Detection ( 5 images for training )

This repo uses the Mask RCNN model from Matterport to train a custom model for detection hairloss areas in head. See example of detection below:
you can seen that the model accuracy is so weak , because it has trained on 5 #images# only. but more annotations will lead to high accuracy.
